# My dotfiles

I put my dotfiles here so that I can easily reference them and sync them between machines using [Dotter](https://github.com/SuperCuber/dotter).
If you get some use out of them, great!
I **do not** recommend using most files from this repository as-is- they are customized for my own use cases and may or may not work for you.
